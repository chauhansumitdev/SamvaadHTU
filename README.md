## Project Description
In response to the challenges faced in gathering feedback on police
operations, our team has undertaken the development of a
comprehensive Police Feedback System. This initiative aims to
revolutionize the traditional, non-digital methods of feedback,
addressing issues such as limited accessibility, outdated practices,
and privacy concerns.

### Problem Statement
The current state of obtaining feedback on police operations is
hindered by outdated methodologies and privacy concerns. Traditional
methods, including inspections and calls to complainants, are
restricted and lack inclusivity, resulting in a gap in understanding
community sentiments and effectively addressing policing issues.

### Background
Existing feedback methods are non-digital, leading to a lack of uniform
guest records and an absence of a standardized tracking system.
Limited manpower further inhibits daily follow-ups, and the diverse,
less digitally aware community adds complexity to the process.
Recognizing these challenges, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
for model police stations emphasize the need for regular feedback to
enhance transparency and efficiency.

### Solution
Our solution involves the design and implementation of a user-friendly
and cost-effective Police Feedback System that incorporates various
components to cater to the diverse needs of the community.

### Components
`Bulk SMS Tool`: A tool designed to gather quick comments on
experiences, allowing users to express whether they are 'Happy' or 'Not
Happy' with police interactions.
`Auto Chatbot`: Engaging users with questions and compiling real-time
answers, the chatbot provides an interactive space for users to share
their feedback and concerns.
`Online Portal`: A centralized platform to record detailed comments,
providing a holistic view of community sentiments and feedback.
`Social Media-Like Platform`: Enabling users to share their experiences
and tag specific locations for easy categorization, fostering community
engagement and transparency


### User Features
